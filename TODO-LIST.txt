User Stories 

#1 - See a list of all products 
- pending : perhaps touch up the dummy data a bit to have same individuals in different projects, 
autogenerator didn't repeat individuals

#2 - Able to add a product : 
backend : PSEUDOCODE created
frontend : handle developers particularities pending (aka how to  get frontend to properly send data to the endpoint)

#3 - Able to edit an existing product : 
backend : PSEUDOCODE created
frontend : handle input field particularities pending (aka how to get frontend to properly send data to the endpoint)

BONUSES 

A- Filter by scrum master. (right now specific scrum master hardcoded)
backend : implemented 
frontend : need dropdown w/ existing scrum masters

B- Filter by developer. (right now specific developer hardcoded)
backend : implemented 
frontend : need dropdown w/ existing developers

C- Swagger documentation of the endpoints

Thoughts : 
remember to make readme w/ proper instructions to launch the project frontend and backend 
endpoints in the backend could be improved if connected to actual database, as not all data would have to be read in from a file every time.
considered solution is to (if time available) continue to read from file, but have a redux store that will keep the data once the fetch has occurred , so as to not have to re-read from the file everytime
