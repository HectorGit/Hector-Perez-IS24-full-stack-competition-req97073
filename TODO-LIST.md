-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A- Filter by scrum master. (right now specific scrum master hardcoded)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OTHER 

### Thoughts : 
turn the productsPage (currently a function) into a react component to use lifecycle method to load data on component load
update readme before submitting

### Future optimizations : 
redux to cache the data, and actual database (?)
